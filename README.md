# Miami_Retail-Shops_Analysis
Daily sales fluctuate, but leadership lacks clarity on why; understanding how weather and customer demographics impact performance will provide insights to improve planning, staffing and promotions.

# Purpose
Provide insights to improve planning, staffing, and promotions.

# Key Questions
•	How strongly do temperature and rainfall affect daily sales?

•	Which shop performs best and why?

•	Who are our customers-families vs singles, male vs female – and how does this change overtime?

•	Are there predictable seasonal patterns in sales?

•	What actions would you take based on these insights?

# Insights

•	There is clear picture of how weather drives customer demand.

•	Insights on family vs. single, with family having a higher frequency than singles particularly on weekends. 

•	On the other hand, females have an edge over males on shopping patterns. 

•	Shop level comparisons to guide staffing and inventory.


# Recommendations
Sales are sharped by weather, location, and customer mix. To maximize growth, managers must adapt operations to seasonal shifts and customer patterns.
•	Staff and stock up on hot summer days.

•	Run rainy-day discounts to keep traffic steady.

•	Expand Miami in peak tourism months.

•	Build loyalty in Jacksonville.

•	Target families on weekends and singles on weekdays.
